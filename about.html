              Shane Anthony Hingtgen currently works as a Distribution Field
              Designer at an engineering firm. He is currently going to school
              at Bellevue University to become a Web Developer and will graduate
              in the spring of 2024. Previously he was working as a Wind
              Technician and would travel around troubleshooting and maintaining
              wind turbines. From an early age he has never had a fear of
              heights, according to his parents, at age six he snuck up the
              ladder behind his father who was installing a satellite dish at
              their house.

              Shane grew up camping every weekend with his family and they would
              go on vacations to national parks over summer break while in high
              school, it was a fantastic experience. One day he hopes to bring
              his wife and kids on those same vacations and even more of them
              around the country. His hobbies are fishing, hunting, hiking and
              gaming with his brothers. Shane is excited for the future, and
              cannot wait to share the enjoyment of his hobbies with his kids
              when they get old. Of course Shane and his Wife, Ally only have a
              one year old currently, but plan on having more kids upon
              graduation in the Spring of 2024. Shane is also planning on
              volunteering in wildlife conservation groups after graduation
              because he loves the outdoors and its incredible whenever people
              get together to open more public wildlife places for everyone to
              enjoy. Some of Shane's favorite places to visit have been North
              East Iowa, the Black Hills, Yellowstone National Park and the
              Grand Tetons National Park.
